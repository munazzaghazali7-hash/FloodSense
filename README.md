## üöÄ Inspiration

Every year, floods cause unprecedented damage to life and property in India. The critical gap we identified is not the lack of data, but the **delay in communicating actionable warnings** to the right people at the right time. FloodSense bridges this gap by automating the entire pipeline from data to decision.

## ‚ö° What It Does

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Continuously monitors real-time water level and rainfall data from simulated government APIs (CWC/IMD).
2.  **Risk Prediction:** Employs a rule-based AI model (designed for easy replacement with ML) to assess flood risk.
3.  **Multi-Channel Alerting:** Instantly triggers alerts via:
    *   **SMS** (using Twilio/TextLocal API)
    *   **Email**
    *   **Telegram**
4.  **Real-time Dashboard:** Provides a live web dashboard for authorities to monitor river conditions and alert statuses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Chart.js, Leaflet.js
*   **Notifications:** Twilio API, TextLocal API, SMTP (Gmail), Telegram Bot API
*   **Data:** Simulated CWC/IMD API data (ready for real API integration)
*   **Deployment:** Ready for deployment on Replit, Heroku, or any Linux server.
