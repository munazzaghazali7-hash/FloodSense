**FloodSense** is an automated early warning system that predicts flash floods using real-time river data and disseminates life-saving alerts via SMS, Email, and Telegram, empowering communities to act before disaster strikes.

> **Built for:** Smart India Hackathon 2025 | **Theme:** Disaster Management & Clean Tech

## üöÄ Inspiration

Every year, floods cause unprecedented damage to life and property in India. The critical gap we identified is not the lack of data, but the **delay in communicating actionable warnings** to the right people at the right time. FloodSense bridges this gap by automating the entire pipeline from data to decision.

## ‚ö° What It Does

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Continuously monitors real-time water level and rainfall data from simulated government APIs (CWC/IMD).
2.  **Risk Prediction:** Employs a rule-based AI model (designed for easy replacement with ML) to assess flood risk.
3.  **Multi-Channel Alerting:** Instantly triggers alerts via:
    *   **SMS** (using Twilio/TextLocal API)
    *   **Email**
    *   **Telegram**
4.  **Real-time Dashboard:** Provides a live web dashboard for authorities to monitor river conditions and alert statuses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Chart.js, Leaflet.js
*   **Notifications:** Twilio API, TextLocal API, SMTP (Gmail), Telegram Bot API
*   **Data:** Simulated CWC/IMD API data (ready for real API integration)
*   **Deployment:** Ready for deployment on Replit, Heroku, or any Linux server.

```
### 5. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
The backend API server will start at http://localhost:5000.
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to view the dashboard.
```

**üéÆ Usage**
View Dashboard: The home page shows the current river data, risk level, and a history chart.

Send Test Alert: Use the dashboard form to send a test alert via all configured channels.

Simulate Emergency: Click "Simulate Emergency" to trigger a high-risk scenario and see the alert system in action.

API Endpoints: The system exposes a clean REST API for integration:

GET /api/station-data - Fetch current river data and risk assessment.

POST /api/send-alert - Trigger an alert manually (accepts message, sms_to, email_to in JSON body).

GET /api/health - Check API status.
